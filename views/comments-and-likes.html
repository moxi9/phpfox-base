<div class="row">
	<p>
		When you create an item you would use the <b>feed</b> table to store this item. By simply loading the feed in the PHP controller and adding the
		Twig function we created in the HTML file it will load our built-in comment/like block.
	</p>
	<p>
		This block is connected to the main feed. So any likes/comments added here will show up in the main feed.
